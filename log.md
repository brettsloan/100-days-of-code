# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 2nd, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**Javascript Challenges** I only have about an hour or so before I have things to do today so a quick JS challenge or two
**1st Challenge** Create a redundant function that takes in a str argument and returns a str. The orignial function should return a function
**2nd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.
**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.
**4th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.
**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number a and finds the missing exponent x so that a when raised to the power of x is equal to b.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refreshed my knowledge on ES6; 'let', 'const', arrow functions, etc.
There's always a bunch of ways to do things and it's not always as hard as it seems.
