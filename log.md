# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 2nd, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** I only have about an hour or so before I have things to do today so a quick JS challenge or two

**1st Challenge** Create a redundant function that takes in a str argument and returns a str. The orignial function should return a function

**2nd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.

**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.

**4th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.

**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number a and finds the missing exponent x so that a when raised to the power of x is equal to b.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refreshed my knowledge on ES6; 'let', 'const', arrow functions, etc.
There's always a bunch of ways to do things and it's not always as hard as it seems.

### Day 2: Dec 3rd, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**HTML/CSS practice** Created a fully functioning mini blog for a client. 
**JavaScript practice** Helped someone with their JS assignment while challenging myself at the same time.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refresher on basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript


### Day 3: Dec 4th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** Went back to edabit.com for more challenges 
**JavaScript Tutorial** Tried to follow along with a JS Tutorial on seperation concepts @ https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057 but it was more like copying and pasting. No real lessons learned as I didn't quite grasp the underlying concepts. May re-visit later on 

**1st Challenge** Write a function that checks if two numbers are either: Smaller than 0, Greater than 0 or Exactly 0.

**2nd Challenge** Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.

**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer and returns a string with the given number of "a"s in Edabit.

**4th Challenge** Create a function to multiply all values in an array by the amount of values in that array.

**5th Challenge** A number added with its additive inverse equals zero.

**6th Challenge** Create a function that takes a string and returns the word count. The string will be a sentence.

**7th Challenge** Create a function that adds a string ending to each member in an array.

**8th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number (from 1 - 60) and returns a corresponding string of hyphens.

**9th Challenge** Create a function that returns the smaller number.

#### Things Learned: ####
'.map()' is a very useful method I learned within these challenges. 
The challenges themselves were quite easy which  makes me feel pretty good that they're classified as 'medium' difficulty.
May need to move up to 'Hard' soon.


### Day 4: Dec 5th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** Busy day today, so used about an hour and half and went up 'hard' on edabit.com

**1st Challenge** Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return "Boom!" if the number 7 appears in the array. Otherwise, return "there is no 7 in the array".

**2nd Challenge** Create a function that returns true if a pair of strings constitutes a strange pair, and false otherwise.

**3rd Challenge** Create a function to remove all null values from an array.

**4th Challenge** Write three separate functions, one to retrieve each element in the semantic versioning specification.

**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string.

**6th Challenge** Write a function that takes three string arguments (first, last, word) and returns true if (when alphabetically sorted) word is found between first and last.

**7th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

#### Things Learned: ####
Today I really tried to focus on making my functions as short as possible with ES6 arrow functions and ternary operators.
Saw some RegEx come up and I really don't know anything about them. Will need to learn about those shortly.
'.filter()' is a very cool method which I'll probably need at one point or another. 
Creates a new array by mapping over an exsisting array and passing a function onto each element. Any element that passes the function is added to the new array in sequence. 


### Day 5: Dec 9th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**freecodecamp.org lessons** 

Went through the beginners tutorials on HTML/CSS.
These are very well constructed lessons. There was some stuff I didn't know about so that was refreshing.

#### Things Learned: ####
Mostly about CSS: 
	Variables was huge. I had no idea that even existed and will definitely be useful in the future.
	Animations was another huge one. I did all my animations in Javascript so I had no idea CSS was able to do some of that as well.

### Day 6: Dec 10th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**continue with freecodecamp.org lessons**

Today I continued on through some freecodecamp lessons on Accessibility which was very interesting.
I knew that all imgs needed an alt tag but not really why. It's also really interesting to take into account your contrast levels for people with colour blindness.
There is a ton that I had no idea about so I'm excited to pick this chapter up tomorrow.

I also applied some CSS animations to my personal portfolio to create a nice gentle drop in effect.

Another thing I did today was test my portfolio on all major browsers and learned that Safari does not handle the CSS property of calc(). 
I set fallbacks but it didn't help anything. It was so hard to test as well because I'd have to push to master branch on GitHub and if something broke, I'd have to re-push.
I installed VirtualBox and set up a virtual MacOS running Catalina so I've been playing around in there. Needs more set up though as it does slow down quite a bit at some points.

#### Things Learned: ####
I learned a lot about accessibility although I feel like I'll have to come back every now and then to refresh my understanding of it.
It's extremely important to have a site accessible for everyone.

### Day 7: Dec 12th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**fix MacOS Catalina**

Today I really wanted to try out Xcode and try writing an app or at least play around in it.
While I didn't get that much coding done today, I did switch from VirtualBox to VMWare and that has made MasOS 
so much faster as well as more stable.

#### Things Learned: ####
Played around in Xcode and watched a tutorial on storyboards.

### Day 8: Dec 16th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**Continue to learning and improving on what I already know**

I feel like I'm well versed in HTML/CSS so I wanted to continue on that knowledge and try out SASS finally.
SASS has a ton of different tools that you're able to use and it processes it into CSS.
It seems like a really amazing tool and I get why a lot of people use it.
I Watched tutorials (listed below) to learn about it. 
I followed along with a tutorial youtube and then practiced by playing around with different values.

#### Things Learned: ####
Learned run SASS on VSCode and write variables, mixins and nested CSS selectors.

### Day 9: Dec 18th, 2019 ###
#### Today's Goal: ####
**Continue with FreeCodeCamp.org lessons**

Went through the lessons provided and learned more about Responsive layouts and CSS Grids.
Already knew almost all of it but the section on Grids was super useful as it almost replaces bootstrap.
I'm still working on these lessons as I type this but so far Grids have been insanely useful. 

#### Things Learned: ####
Grid system layout for CSS
