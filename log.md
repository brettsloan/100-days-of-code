# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 2nd, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** I only have about an hour or so before I have things to do today so a quick JS challenge or two
**1st Challenge** Create a redundant function that takes in a str argument and returns a str. The orignial function should return a function
**2nd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.
**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.
**4th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.
**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number a and finds the missing exponent x so that a when raised to the power of x is equal to b.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refreshed my knowledge on ES6; 'let', 'const', arrow functions, etc.
There's always a bunch of ways to do things and it's not always as hard as it seems.

### Day 2: Dec 3rd, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**HTML/CSS practice** Created a fully functioning mini blog for a client. 
**JavaScript practice** Helped someone with their JS assignment while challenging myself at the same time.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refresher on basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript


### Day 3: Dec 4th, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** Went back to edabit.com for more challenges 
**JavaScript Tutorial** Tried to follow along with a JS Tutorial on seperation concepts @ https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057 but it was more like copying and pasting. No real lessons learned as I didn't quite grasp the underlying concepts. May re-visit later on 

**1st Challenge** Write a function that checks if two numbers are either: Smaller than 0, Greater than 0 or Exactly 0.
**2nd Challenge** Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.
**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer and returns a string with the given number of "a"s in Edabit.
**4th Challenge** Create a function to multiply all values in an array by the amount of values in that array.
**5th Challenge** A number added with its additive inverse equals zero.
**6th Challenge** Create a function that takes a string and returns the word count. The string will be a sentence.
**7th Challenge** Create a function that adds a string ending to each member in an array.
**8th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number (from 1 - 60) and returns a corresponding string of hyphens.
**9th Challenge** Create a function that returns the smaller number.

#### Things Learned: ####
'.map()' is a very useful method I learned within these challenges. 
The challenges themselves were quite easy which  makes me feel pretty good that they're classified as 'medium' difficulty.
May need to move up to 'Hard' soon.

### Day 4: Dec 5th, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** Busy day today, so used about an hour and half and went up 'hard' on edabit.com

**1st Challenge** Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return "Boom!" if the number 7 appears in the array. Otherwise, return "there is no 7 in the array".
**2nd Challenge** Create a function that returns true if a pair of strings constitutes a strange pair, and false otherwise.
**3rd Challenge** Create a function to remove all null values from an array.
**4th Challenge** Write three separate functions, one to retrieve each element in the semantic versioning specification.
**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number (from 1 to 12) and returns its corresponding month name as a string.
**6th Challenge** Write a function that takes three string arguments (first, last, word) and returns true if (when alphabetically sorted) word is found between first and last.
**7th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz".

#### Things Learned: ####
Today I really tried to focus on making my functions as short as possible with ES6 arrow functions and ternary operators.
Saw some RegEx come up and I really don't know anything about them. Will need to learn about those shortly.
'.filter()' is a very cool method which I'll probably need at one point or another. 
Creates a new array by mapping over an exsisting array and passing a function onto each element. Any element that passes the function is added to the new array in sequence.
