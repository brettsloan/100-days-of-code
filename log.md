# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 2nd, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** I only have about an hour or so before I have things to do today so a quick JS challenge or two
**1st Challenge** Create a redundant function that takes in a str argument and returns a str. The orignial function should return a function
**2nd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer minutes and converts it to seconds.
**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.
**4th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number as an argument, increments the number by +1 and returns the result.
**5th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number a and finds the missing exponent x so that a when raised to the power of x is equal to b.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refreshed my knowledge on ES6; 'let', 'const', arrow functions, etc.
There's always a bunch of ways to do things and it's not always as hard as it seems.

#### Things Learned: ####
Refresher on basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript


### Day 3: Dec 4th, 2019
#### Today's Goal: ####
**JavaScript Challenges** Went back to edabit.com for more challenges 
**JavaScript Tutorial** Tried to follow along with a JS Tutorial on seperation concepts @ https://medium.com/@michael.karen/learning-modern-javascript-with-tetris-92d532bcd057 but it was more like copying and pasting. No real lessons learned as I didn't quite grasp the underlying concepts. May re-visit later on 

**1st Challenge** Write a function that checks if two numbers are either: Smaller than 0, Greater than 0 or Exactly 0.
**2nd Challenge** Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.
**3rd Challenge** Write a function that takes an integer and returns a string with the given number of "a"s in Edabit.
**4th Challenge** Create a function to multiply all values in an array by the amount of values in that array.
**5th Challenge** A number added with its additive inverse equals zero.
**6th Challenge** Create a function that takes a string and returns the word count. The string will be a sentence.
**7th Challenge** Create a function that adds a string ending to each member in an array.
**8th Challenge** Create a function that takes a number (from 1 - 60) and returns a corresponding string of hyphens.
**9th Challenge** Create a function that returns the smaller number.

#### Things Learned: ####
'.map()' is a very useful method I learned within these challenges. 
The challenges themselves were quite easy which  makes me feel pretty good that they're classified as 'medium' difficulty.
May need to move up to 'Hard' soon.
